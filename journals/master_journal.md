## 2. What’s Working

1. **High R:R Targets** (2.5–3+): winners carry more weight in overall PnL  
2. **Partial Take-Profits:** locking in P1 helps preserve gains  
3. **Consistent session-based planning** (London/New York pre-session checklists)

## 3. Key Pain Points

- **Win rate < 50%:** too many low-probability setups slipping through  
- **SL discipline:** occasional open trades without a hard stop  
- **Insufficient macro bias:** Daily timeframe often omitted, leading to counter-trend entries  
- **Over-exposure:** multiple open trades weren’t scaled or risk-capped per session

## 4. Action Plan

1. **Tighten Confluence Checklist**  
   - Minimum 3–4 factors, always include Daily structure/order block.  
2. **Enforce SL on Every Trade**  
   - Zero exceptions—no open trades without a defined SL.  
3. **Cap Active Trades**  
   - Max 2 per session, 4 per week.  
4. **Track Metrics Weekly**  
   - Update this Master Journal each Friday: win rate, avg R:R, weekly PnL.  
5. **Refine Watchlist**  
   - Focus on 3–4 core pairs where edge is proven (e.g. EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD).
