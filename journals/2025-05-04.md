## ✅ Trade 1 – GBPUSD  

- **Direction:** Sell  
- **Entry:** 1.33478  
- **TP:** 1.33000  
- **Profit:** +$9.56  
- **Execution:** Mistaken Market Execution (intended Sell Limit)

**What went well:**  

- Trade hit full TP even though it was a mistaken market order—bias and zone were still valid.  
- Market moved cleanly in favor due to high timeframe bearish structure aligning with liquidity grab above previous highs.

**What could be improved:**  

- Execution precision. Even though the trade worked, mistaken order types can result in unnecessary losses in tighter setups.

**TJR Tip:** “Even mistakes can work if your bias is clean—but don’t rely on that. Execution discipline is what builds longevity.”

## ✅ Trade 2 – GBPUSD  

- **Direction:** Sell  
- **Entry:** 1.33366  
- **TP:** 1.32000  
- **TP1:** 1.32979  
- **Profit:** +$7.74 (50% partials, SL at BE hit)

**What went well:**  

- You took 50% at TP1 and secured the trade with SL at BE. Great application of capital protection.  
- Bias aligned with previous lower high supply and internal structure shift.

**What could be improved:**  

- You could consider scaling out with smaller % (e.g., 30%) at TP1 to let more volume ride. But this comes down to personality.

- **SL:** Moved to BE  
- **Current Price:** 1.32694  
- **Running Profit:** +$16.12  
- **Realized:** +$10.46

**What went well:**  

- Clean sell stop execution—textbook TJR move grabbing breakout traders and flipping structure.  
- Good discipline on taking partials at TP1 and moving SL to breakeven.

**What to monitor:**  

- Lock in more profits at next levels (1.3250, 1.3220). Don’t let price return fully if you’re seeing early signs of reversal.

## 🟨 Trade 4 – XAUUSD *(Ongoing)*  

- **Direction:** Sell  
- **Entry:** $3,260.00  
- **TP:** $3,140.00  
- **Current Price:** ~$3,230.00  
- **Running Profit:** +$38.44  
- **No partials or SL set**

**What went well:**  

- You caught the premium zone after price tapped into H4 imbalance. Direction is valid, and trade is running in good profit.

**What could be improved:**  

- No SL or partials at this stage = exposure. You’re up nearly $40—lock some in. Adjust SL to protect equity.  
- Consider TP1 near $3,220 area (equal lows) to scale out safely.
