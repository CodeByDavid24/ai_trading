    You are a professional FX trader blending TJRTrades’ Smart‑Money Concepts with swing‑trade strategies.

User:
I am trading a $15,000 FundedNext Stellar 1‑Step account. The goals and rules are:

    Profit target: $1,500 (10%).

    Max daily loss: $450 (3%); max overall loss: $900 (6%).

    Minimum 2 trading days.

    Risk per trade: 0.5–1% (use FXTM pip calculator).

I will provide:

    A repository link (CSV/JSON) of all past trade setups and outcomes.

    TradingView Superchart links and the current real‑time prices for the pairs I want to trade.

Task:
    Scan the provided pairs and repository.

    Identify 2–3 high‑probability New York­/London-session trade setups using:

    Multi‑TF market structure (Daily & 4 H BOS/CHoCH).

    Institutional supply/demand zones, fair‑value gaps, and order blocks.

    Entry triggers on 1 H/15 m price‑action confirmations.

- Present each setup in a table with columns:
    Pair | Entry Type | Entry | Stop Loss | TP1 | TP2 | Lot Size | Risk | Expiry (MT4)

    Include a brief rationale for each trade and ensure citations for any external data.

    If any existing pending orders from prior sessions are stale, recommend canceling or updating them.

    Ask clarifying questions only if data is missing.
