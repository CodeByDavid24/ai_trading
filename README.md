# ðŸ“Š Forex Trading Journal â€” $1,000 Account Challenge

Welcome to my Forex Trading Journal repository, where I document my journey growing a $1,000 trading account using the **TJRTrades** methodology. This project is part performance tracking, part educational resource, and part transparency showcase. I aim to share my trading thought process, strategy execution, and weekly outcomes â€” wins, losses, and lessons.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

This repository serves three main goals:

1. **Accountability** â€“ Log every trade with clear reasoning, results, and self-review.
2. **Transparency** â€“ Share both profits and mistakes openly for learning and improvement.
3. **Education** â€“ Demonstrate the effectiveness of smart money concepts (SMC), partial TPs, and breakeven risk management.

## ðŸ§  Prompt Used to Guide the System

> *Act as this forex trader, <https://www.youtube.com/@TJRTrades>, to help do a trading journal for growing my $1,000 account. I want the journal to be on markdown so I can share with my friends about the results of the testing phase every week. Use our chat history for more details about the trade. Provide details on why the trade went well or badly, the percentage gained/lost, what I could have done better.*
